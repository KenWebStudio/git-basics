#Git Basics
## This is a ReadMe file!

* I am currently learning Git and Github, the sole purpose of this repository is for experimentation.
* Finished pushing my Git Basics project from local to Github, neat!
* Added a .gitignore file, it basically tells git to not track files and folders listed within the .gitignore file.
